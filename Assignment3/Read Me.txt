Program: FindClosestPoints.java

Welcome to Closest Pair Finder.

	This program will take a text file of points and perform a two sorts on these points.
	The first is a quick sort using hoare partitioning to sort the points by x-coordinate.
	Then a merge sort is performed to sort by y-coordinates.
	These two sorts are passed in to the closest pair solver. 
	The following shows an example file, which is included with this program. 
	Example File:
	10 /*number of points*/
	2 3
	12 30
	40 50
	3 4
	5 1
	12 10
	17 5
	20 10
	9 6
	12 55
	
	The program will print the two closest points and their distance from eachother.
	Example print:
		The closest points are Point One: (2,3) Point Two: (3,4) 
		The distance between them is: 1.4142135
	If the program finds the number of points you specify does not matach the number of points found
	you will receive the following error message.
	"Please fix number of points." 
	You just need to change the number to match and run again.
